# end-to-end-heart-disease-classification
Predicting heart disease using machine learning. This notebook explores the use of various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to build a model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
